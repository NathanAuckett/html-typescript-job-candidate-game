# HTML/TypeScript Job Candidate Game

This project was created as a job candidate project.<br>
This was my first time making a game in JavaScript/Typescript and HTML5 Canvas.

The game runs entirely through the HTML5 canvas.<br>
No frameworks or game engines have been used.<br>
All code is written by me.<br>
Graphics are examples provided by the company.<br>

The game uses a custom Component based system to manage game objects.
All game objects are "Components" and function via the same framework.
A Game Manager class tracks and updates each component in the game, in order.

You can play the game on github pages, here: https://nathanauckett.github.io/matific-candidate-game/
